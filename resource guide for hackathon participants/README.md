# 🌱 EcoHack for Restoration Ecology 🌿  
### Hackathon Application Ideas 💡  

1. **Intelligent Chatbots** 🤖  
   - Provide personalized recommendations  
   - Chat with an ecologist  
   - Chat with research papers  
   - Incorporate evidence  
   - Include information on the reliability of results  

2. **Convert Research Papers into Presentation Slide Decks** 🖼️  

3. **Data Analysis and Visualization** 📊  
   - Summarize data findings  
     - Compute topic models and display  
     - Generate summaries in various styles: lay or scientific  
   - Create visualizations based on data trends  
   - Provide natural language explanations of complex datasets  

4. **Build a Knowledge Graph of Findings in Ecology** 🧠  
   - Identify information extraction targets  
     - Build comparisons using [ORKG](https://orkg.org/)  
   - Extract information about causal and mechanistic models  
   - Detect concept/term ambiguity (e.g., multiple meanings of "enemy")  

5. **Search Interfaces** 🔎  
   - Fair and diverse results  
     - Rank by preferences (e.g., temporal, location, discipline)  
     - Label source types (scientific papers, grey literature, etc.)  
   - Query builder with templates and SPARQL translation  

6. **Tools for Synthesizing Research Papers** 📚  
   - Detect ecosystems and map them  
     - Use [IUCN's ecosystem typology](https://iucn.org/resources/publication/iucn-global-ecosystem-typology-20)  
   - Extract models/variables  
   - Detect species and link them to ontologies (images?)  
   - Summarize papers for different audiences (e.g., laypeople via [BioLaySumm](https://biolaysumm.org/))  

7. **Incorporating Grey Literature** 🗂️  
   - Combine results from scientific and grey literature, retaining source information  

8. **Summarizing IPBES Reports** 🌏  
   - Explore [global biodiversity reports](https://www.ipbes.net/assessment-reports/ldr)  
   - Task ideas: topic modeling, chatbots, or Q&A over reports  

9. **Futzy 2.0** on [Github](https://github.com/EcoWeaver/Futzy) 🌐  
   - Support for fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) extensions (delay, conditional...)  
   - Merge two FCMs  

10. **Developing an Ontology with LLMs** 🧬  
    - Input: hypotheses, abstracts, and datasets  
    - Use LLMs for term extraction and ontology building  
    - Define hierarchies and relations, evaluate via [INBIO](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/INBIO)
