# üå± EcoHack for Restoration Ecology üåø  
### Hackathon Application Ideas üí°  

1. **Intelligent Chatbots** ü§ñ  
   - Provide personalized recommendations  
   - Chat with an ecologist  
   - Chat with research papers  
   - Incorporate evidence  
   - Include information on the reliability of results  
   
2. **LLM-powered Search System for Ecologists**
   - Start from the [ORKG ASK](https://ask.orkg.org/) platform  
     - Integrate the device of follow-up questions to the first search question 
	 - Implement a chat with your paper feature
	 - Implement feedback mechanisms
	 - others ...

3. **Convert Research Papers into Presentation Slide Decks** üñºÔ∏è  

4. **Data Analysis and Visualization** üìä  
   - Summarize data findings  
     - Compute topic models and display  
     - Generate summaries in various styles: lay or scientific  
   - Create visualizations based on data trends  
   - Provide natural language explanations of complex datasets  

5. **Build a Knowledge Graph of Findings in Ecology** üß†  
   - Identify information extraction targets  
     - Build comparisons using [ORKG](https://orkg.org/)  
   - Extract information about causal and mechanistic models  
   - Detect concept/term ambiguity (e.g., multiple meanings of "enemy")  

6. **Search Interfaces** üîé  
   - Fair and diverse results  
     - Rank by preferences (e.g., temporal, location, discipline)  
     - Label source types (scientific papers, grey literature, etc.)  
   - Query builder with templates and SPARQL translation  

7. **Tools for Synthesizing Research Papers** üìö  
   - Detect ecosystems and map them  
     - Use [IUCN's ecosystem typology](https://iucn.org/resources/publication/iucn-global-ecosystem-typology-20)  
   - Extract models/variables  
   - Detect species and link them to ontologies (images?)  
   - Summarize papers for different audiences (e.g., laypeople via [BioLaySumm](https://biolaysumm.org/))  

8. **Incorporating Grey Literature** üóÇÔ∏è  
   - Combine results from scientific and grey literature, retaining source information  

9. **Summarizing IPBES Reports** üåè  
   - Explore [global biodiversity reports](https://www.ipbes.net/assessment-reports/ldr)  
   - Task ideas: topic modeling, chatbots, or Q&A over reports  

10. **Futzy 2.0** on [Github](https://github.com/EcoWeaver/Futzy) üåê  
   - Support for fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) extensions (delay, conditional...)  
   - Merge two FCMs  

11. **Developing an Ontology with LLMs** üß¨  
    - Input: hypotheses, abstracts, and datasets  
    - Use LLMs for term extraction and ontology building  
    - Define hierarchies and relations, evaluate via [INBIO](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/INBIO)
